Online voting system 


-->We created a DBMS-based online voting system for easy and secure vote
casting.

-->Provided distinct interfaces for users and administrators where users could
easily vote, while the admin monitored the election.


-->Used HTML, CSS, and PHP for the front-end with a MySQL back-end for
efficient data management.
